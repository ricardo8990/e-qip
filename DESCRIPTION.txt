James Bond Skiing Game:

James Bond is running away from enemy state's agent.
He needs to get down a mountain slope, before the enemy catches up with him.  
On his way down he must collect as many coins/intelligence as he can so as not to fail M.
If he can make it to the end of the slope safely, an MI6 helicopter is waiting to pick him up.

Playing guide:
James Bond can slide left, right and down using the left, right, down keys respectively.

In order to get the highest score:
Collect as many coins as you can to increase mission points.
Any contact with the enemy agent is fatal.  He is trained to kill.
You can track Bond's number of lives by the lives points.
Any contact with trees will damage Bond's health.
You can track Bond's health by the health points.  Every time it drops to 0, lives points will decrease by 1.
Bond has the ability to resurrect himself three times, thanks to Q.

Levels:
The slope gets steeper each level and so the speeds increase.  Tree crashes get more damaging as a result.
