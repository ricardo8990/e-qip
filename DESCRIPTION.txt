James Bond Skiing Game:

James Bond is running away from enemy state's agent.
He needs to get down a mountain slope, before the enemy catches up with him.  
On his way down he must collect as many coins/intelligence as he can so as not to fail M.
If he can make it to the end of the slope safely, an MI6 helicopter is waiting to pick him up.
